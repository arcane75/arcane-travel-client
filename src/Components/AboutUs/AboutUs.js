                    <h2>Benefit from orthodontics </h2>
                    <h5>Only your dentist or orthodontist can determine whether you can benefit from orthodontics. Based on diagnostic tools that include a full medical and dental health history, a clinical exam, plaster models of your teeth, and special X-rays and photographs, an orthodontist or dentist can decide whether orthodontics are recommended, and develop a treatment plan that’s right for you.

The benefits of orthodontic treatment include a healthier mouth, a more pleasing appearance, and teeth that are more likely to last a lifetime.</h5>

                    <h2>whitening Gel</h2>
                    <h5>Home whitening gel usually needs to be applied daily for two to three weeks. Over-the-counter kits also are widely available for home use. They provide trays to hold the gel, or whitening strips that stick to your teeth. Talk to your dentist if you want to use these home products. Be sure to follow directions to avoid overuse and possible damage to your teeth and mouth. </h5>

                    <h4>Our orthodontist treats problems such as:</h4>
                    <h5>Overbites: When you have an overbite, your front upper teeth cover your lower teeth when you bite down.
Underbites: If you have an underbite, your lower teeth cover your front upper teeth when you bite down.
Overcrowding: This condition happens when there are too many teeth in the same area of the jaw.
Tooth spacing problems: You may have a gap between two teeth that are next to each other. This problem can occur if you lose a tooth and do not replace it with an artificial one — the remaining teeth on either side may tilt towards the open space.</h5>
                    <br />
                    <h4> What Is An Orthodontist?</h4>
                    <h5> An orthodontist specializes in fixing problems that happen when your teeth are out of alignment. Straight teeth are easier to keep clean, which lowers your risk for cavities and gum disease. They also help your jaw work efficiently so you can avoid joint and muscle problems.</h5>
